Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Kyabjé Trulshik Rinpoche
by His Holiness the Dalai Lama

drangyé kalpar tukkyé damché tü
Through the power of your bodhicitta vow over countless aeons,
dü dir yongdzok gyalten saldzepé
In our time, you illuminated the entire teaching of the buddhas,
sumden duldzin dampar soldeb na
Venerable vinaya master and upholder of the three vows, to you we pray:
yangtrul shyönnü zukku nyur char sol
Appear again swiftly as a youthful rūpakāya emanation!

A disciple of this sublime master, the Buddhist monk Tenzin Gyatso, wrote down just whatever
came into his mind, in an airport in Argentina, on the eighteenth day of the seventh month
of the Tibetan royal year 2138, the year of the Iron Rabbit, 15 September 2011. Virtue!
