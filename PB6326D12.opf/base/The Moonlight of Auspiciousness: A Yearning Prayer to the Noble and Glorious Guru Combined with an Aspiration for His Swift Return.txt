The Moonlight of Auspiciousness

A Yearning Prayer to the Noble and Glorious Guru Combined with an Aspiration for His Swift Return

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

I pray to the lord of the maṇḍala, seated amidst an oceanOf absolute perfection, the purified
dependent nature,A vidyādhara with power over unchanging longevity,In primordially immutable
and vajra-like great bliss.[1]

Through the blessings of the Mañjughoṣa Guru,[2]You came to hold a jewel treasury of Dharma,
profound and vast,And to bind fast the essences within the central channel—Guru of genuine
discipline, to you I pray.

Dance-like emanation, magical embodiment of the wisdomOf the three secrets of the great translator
Vairotsana,Your activity to train the beings of this degenerate age—Chimé Nangdzé Dorje,[3]
to you I pray.

Gracious Vajradhara, your kindness is incomparable.Representative of the Victor, you are beyond
compare.Chimé Nangdzé Dorje, I invoke your wisdom mind:Consider us from the imperceptible,
absolute sphere.

As we call out in cries of lamentation and despair,Bless us so that all our dharmic aspirations
and actionsMay be accomplished without any hindrance,And our family, Dharma, lifespan,
merit, and resources increase!

Protector, may you swiftly return in a compassionate emanation,A noble friend and supporter
of the teachings and beings,And help us, your disciples to be trained,To fulfil our aspirations
entirely.

May you always guide and care for me, O guruAnd glorious protector, in all my lives to come,So
that through faith, samaya and the two stages,I may swiftly attain the level of a Vajra
Holder!

When the father-guru merged into the all-pervasive, absolute expanse of clear light, I, Jamyang
Chökyi Lodrö, whom this protector nurtured in his boundless compassion, composed this
prayer as a call for his swift return combined with words of aspiration. Siddhirastu!
