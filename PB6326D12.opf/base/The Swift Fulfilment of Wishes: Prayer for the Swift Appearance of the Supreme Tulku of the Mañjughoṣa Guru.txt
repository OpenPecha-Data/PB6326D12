Embodiment of the blessings of the gurus of the three transmissions,1

Great conveyer of the entire teachings of the victorious Buddha—

Orgyen Chökyi Gyatso, to you I pray.

Grant your blessings so that the youthful moon, exalted and sublime,
namtar pema karpö treng dzinpa
That is your emanation, holder of the white lotus garland of liberation,
dak sok drowé gön du nyur jön né
May swiftly appear as my own and others’ protector
ten drö dön chen drubpar jingyi lob
To bring immense benefit to the teachings and beings.

Thus, in response to a request from Khenpo Lekshe Jorden, Jamyang Lodrö Gyatso wrote this on
the first day of the month of miracules during the sixteenth calendrical cycle.
